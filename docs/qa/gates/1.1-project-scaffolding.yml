# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Secrets properly excluded via .gitignore, no hardcoded credentials, environment variable template provided"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Worker bundle size excellent (22.05 KiB / 5.63 KiB gzipped), TypeScript compilation fast, build pipeline efficient"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling in Worker entry point, 404 fallback for unimplemented routes, compatibility flags correct"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear file organization, well-commented code, comprehensive documentation, self-documenting configuration"

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive compiler flags (noUnusedLocals, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, etc.)"
    - "Clean Worker entry point with proper Env interface typing and unused parameter prefixes"
    - "Well-organized configuration files following Cloudflare Workers best practices"
    - "Proper use of nodejs_compat flag (modern replacement for deprecated node_compat)"
    - "Comprehensive .gitignore covering all build artifacts and secrets"
    - "Professional placeholder dashboard with inline styling for zero external dependencies"
    - "Successful build pipeline execution with zero TypeScript errors"
    - "All 12 acceptance criteria verified and passing"

  observations:
    - "Wrangler version outdated (3.82.0 vs 4.46.0) but functional for current needs"
    - "vite.config.ts references future dashboard HTML file appropriately for scaffolding phase"
    - "PostCSS config uses CommonJS while other configs use ES modules - acceptable for tooling compatibility"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Update Wrangler to v4 for latest features and security patches"
      priority: "low"
      refs: ["package.json:32"]
      rationale: "Current version (3.82.0) is functional but outdated. v4.46.0 available with improvements."
    - action: "Implement dashboard HTML file when reaching dashboard development story"
      priority: "low"
      refs: ["vite.config.ts:18"]
      rationale: "Currently references non-existent file which is expected for scaffolding phase."
