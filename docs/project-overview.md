# AIRescheduler - Project Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-09
**Project Type:** Greenfield Cloudflare Workers SaaS
**Status:** Initial Setup Phase

---

## Executive Summary

AIRescheduler is a Cloudflare Workers-based SaaS application that automates weather-aware flight lesson scheduling for flight schools. The system continuously monitors weather forecasts, evaluates impact against training-level safety thresholds, and automatically reschedules conflicted flights or raises advisory alerts.

The core innovation combines deterministic weather rules with Workers AI reasoning to generate three vetted alternate lesson slots—complete with rationale—within seconds of identifying risk, giving schedulers confidence to act without manual data analysis.

---

## Business Value

- **Detect and classify ≥95%** of weather conflicts for flights within 72 hours
- **Auto-reschedule ≥70%** of conflicted flights with ≥80% staff acceptance rate
- **Reduce manual monitoring burden** through hourly autonomous execution
- **Maintain safety compliance** with full audit trail of automated decisions
- **Provide single-pane dashboard** for 2-minute conflict resolution

---

## Technical Architecture

### Stack

- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers (compatibility date 2024-11-08)
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- **AI:** Workers AI (`@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`)
- **Weather Data:** WeatherAPI.com REST API
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS
- **Build:** Vite 5.x + TypeScript 5.x (strict mode)
- **Deployment:** Wrangler 3.x CLI

### Architecture Patterns

- Single Worker module with dual handlers: `fetch` (dashboard + RPC) and `scheduled` (cron)
- RPC bridge (Zod-validated) connects dashboard to Worker services
- Service layer architecture: pure functions accepting `ExecutionContext` and DTOs
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs for all operations
- D1 schema with normalized tables and referential integrity

### Key Components

1. **Weather Monitoring Engine:** Hourly polling of WeatherAPI.com for departure, arrival, and corridor checkpoints
2. **Threshold Classification:** Training-level rules (student, private, instrument) mark flights as clear, advisory, or auto-reschedule
3. **AI Rescheduling Engine:** Workers AI generates three ranked alternate slots with rationale
4. **Manager Dashboard:** React UI with flight board, weather timeline, suggestions, and notifications
5. **Cron Automation:** Autonomous hourly execution orchestrating weather poll → classification → rescheduling

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Weather API downtime:** Fallback to cached snapshots with staleness warnings

- **D1 scaling limits:** Design for 500 active flights; partition by school for multi-tenant
- **Cron overlapping runs:** 120-second pipeline timeout prevents overlap

### Domain Risks
- **Safety compliance:** Maintain audit trail for regulator reviews
- **Instructor certification:** Validate reschedule candidates respect credentials
- **Human oversight:** All auto-reschedules include manual accept/reject controls
- **Weather data integrity:** Schema validation and staleness detection
